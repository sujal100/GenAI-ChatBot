Inspired by companies like GitLab, which embody a “build in public” philosophy, this project aims to foster transparency, collaboration, and learning. GitLab openly shares its strategies, roadmaps, and internal processes, encouraging community feedback and improvement.

The challenge for this project is to develop an interactive chatbot that allows users— the employees or aspiring employees—to easily access information from GitLab’s Handbook and Direction pages. By providing an engaging interface, the chatbot will retrieve relevant information based on user queries and help users learn in an accessible and engaging way.

GitLab’s 10-year product vision is inspired by our mission to make it so that everyone can contribute. Today GitLab is the DevSecOps Platform, empowering organizations to maximize the overall return on software development by delivering software faster and efficiently, while strengthening security and compliance.

First, we expect to continue rapidly maturing our DevSecOps platform so that GitLab is able to replace any DevSecOps point solution. To replace any DevSecOps solution will require most of our categories to be complete, which is likely a 10-year journey. To ensure rapid progress, we have a 3-year goal to have 50% of our categories at complete maturity by the end of 2023.

Second, we expect GitLab to expand its DevSecOps platform to provide similar support for ModelOps and DataOps. Over time, data and machine learning/AI models will increasingly power software experiences. Our customers will need an ability to manage data and its associated ML/AI models in a similar fashion to software projects.

Third, we expect GitLab to become a creation platform for all digital content. This will require us to expand beyond traditional software development. Possible new digital content creation formats we could support include low code/no code development, design creation, and other creative media like music and movies.

We execute on our vision rapidly and efficiently by leveraging the best practices of 100,000 organizations co-developing the DevSecOps platform of their dreams. We take a seed then nurture approach to maturing our product surface area over time, all the while focusing on customer results.

GitLab competes in a large market space and is uniquely positioned with a vision to offer a single application for the entire DevSecOps lifecycle. GitLab competes across numerous market segments and aims to deliver value in 80+ market categories. GitLab’s product vision is uniquely ambitious, as we were the first DevSecOps player to take a single application approach.

Strategic challenges include the tension between breadth and depth, balancing GitLab.com and self-managed offerings, serving a wide customer profile, and competition from larger companies like Microsoft, Atlassian, and Synopsys.

Product Strategy:
- Focus on increasing Stages per Organization (SpO): There is a strong correlation between the number of stages customers use and their propensity to upgrade to a paid package.
- Harness the unique power of a single application: GitLab’s primary point of differentiation is our single application approach.
- Increase wider-community contributions: To achieve this ambitious vision more quickly, we will leverage our powerful open source community.
- Make our core journey categories complete: We want to ensure the core product usage experience is great, which will lead to more paying customers and improved customer retention.
- GitLab-hosted first: Most customers don't want to run GitLab themselves (self-managed), so we should build out the offerings where we do it for them (GitLab-hosted).
